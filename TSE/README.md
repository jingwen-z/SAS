- Applied Multivariate Project-HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSCRIPTION AND MEDICAL SERVICES IN THE US STATES

  The question of health has been for many years a very controversial topic in the United States. Unlike 
in France, health care in the US is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of US population was still uninsured 
which represents more than 42 million of individuals. In July 1965, President Johnson leading the country, 
the Congress created Medicare to provide health insurance to people above 64 years older, people under age 
65 with certain disabilities, and people of all ages suffering from End-Stage Renal Disease.

> Objective

  The goal of this paper is to provide an exploratory analysis of the link between the subscription to 
Medicare and the health service provided in the different states of the US and we will also try to specify 
the different profiles of these states with respect to the investment and population.
> The dataset description

  We picked our dataset from the Area Health Resources Files (AHRF), which has a huge database on health 
products. The data comes from official source of the government and was collected in 2011. We have 8 
quantitative variables and 51 observations which corresponds to states in the US.
> The Technics and methods

  We firstly used the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique. We summarized the dataset while trying 
at the same time to keep the maximum of the information contained in the 8 initial variables. The second 
method that we used is Clustering (CL). This technique will enable us to check different state profiles, 
influent ones and maybe some outliers if there is.
